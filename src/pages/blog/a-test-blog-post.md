At the start of every year I set myself a few goals to aim for in the coming months. In 2020, one of those goals was to build a website.

### Why?

As a software engineer by trade and having almost 20 years experience developing sites professionally for other people, I thought it was probably about time I created an outlet for my own thoughts.

Don't get me wrong, I've tried before but nothing really stuck. 

Then social media came along - Friends Reunited, MySpace, Twitter, Facebook and everything in between.  I didn't really see a point to having a blog any more, but after becoming a bit disillusioned with how these platforms (mis)use personal data I decided to retreat, which left me without a space to share my creative thoughts.

### What

There's lots of ways to get a website, they range in price and quality.

The high-level (minimal) costs of a website are:

* A domain name (a website address so people can find your site)
* A host (somewhere to store the files online)
* Design & development of the website

There are other costs associated to professional websites such as content & marketing, which covers things like social media and audience building, but for a blog like mine you might not need this to start.

You can buy domain names from many different providers. There are *lots* of extensions (the bit that comes at the end, i.e. **.com** / **.co.uk** / etc.) and it's a personal choice about the one you choose. If I could offer any guidance, I would always suggest opting for a [top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains) and in particular a **.com** because this is the defacto extension that people think of (earlier browsers used to be programmed to use it when one wasn't provided too).
