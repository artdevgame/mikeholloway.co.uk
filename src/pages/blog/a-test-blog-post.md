At the start of every year I set myself a few goals to aim for in the coming months. In 2020, one of those goals was to build a website.

#### Why?

As a software engineer by trade and having almost 20 years experience developing sites professionally for other people, I thought it was probably about time I created an outlet for my own thoughts.

Don't get me wrong, I've tried before but nothing really stuck. 

Then social media came along - *Friends Reunited*, *MySpace*, *Twitter*, *Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, Instagram, Twitch* and everything in between.  I didn't really see a point to having a blog anymore but time passed and everything became fragmented.

After becoming a little disillusioned with how these platforms (mis)use personal data I decided to retreat from most of them altogether, which left me without a consistent space to share my creative thoughts.

I needed a platform that I could control, somewhere to speak freely without worrying about side affects.

#### What

There's lots of ways to get a website, they range in price and quality.

The high-level (minimal) costs of a website are:

* A domain name (a website address so people can find your site)
* A host (somewhere to store the files online)
* Design & development of the website

There are other costs associated to professional websites such as content & marketing, which covers things like social media and audience building, but for a blog like mine you might not need this to start.

You can buy domain names from many different registrars (middlemen sales companies of registry's such as Verisign and Nominet). There are *lots* of extensions (the bit that comes at the end, i.e. **.com** / **.co.uk** / etc.) and it's a personal choice about the one you choose. If I could offer any guidance, I would always suggest opting for a [top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains) and in particular a **.com** because this is the defacto extension that people think of (earlier browsers used to be programmed to use it when one wasn't provided too).

As the Internet is 24/7 365 days a year, you need a place to store your files that make up the website. Like domain registrars, there's plenty of choice for hosting providers. Quite often you can buy both products through the same provider, i.e. Namecheap, but *you don't have to*. They're independent products.

If you have the inclination to develop the website yourself, all of the costs above can be mitigated completetly to some extent.

#### How to get a "free" website

Website builders such as WordPress or the ones provided by hosting companies usually have a free tier where they provide you with a personalised domain name and just enough space to run a basic site.

One of the major limitations with these sites is when you out grow the initial requirements. You either end up having to pay for a premium plan that costs a lot more or worse, your site would have been constructed in such a way that they can't be ported to another supplier.
