      You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an
      Awesome Life

      **This book changed my life.**


      One day I'll write a full review on my blog as it was so transformational.
      Jen's tone is really accessible, a little crass at times but the message
      she delivers is like a fact-train hitting you square in the face.


      You should read this book if you're feeling in a rut or a little stagnant
      in life. I challenge you to read it and not feel like you've just
      discovered you had super powers all along.

      Understand how to form ideas and how to develop them into reality. I
      really like the language used in this book, it's very simple to follow and
      really inspirational. Good examples of ideas to monetize.

      Side Hustle: Build a Side Business and Make Extra Money â€“ Without Quitting
      Your Day Job

      I'm really inspired by others that have managed to break free of the 9-5
      and chart their own course in life by following their passion but it can
      seem so daunting if you have bills to pay and other responsibilities that
      prevent you going all in. This book is great for giving you ideas on how
      to build side projects when you have a little downtime and how to monetize
      them.


      If you don't have ideas of your own, still read this book as the author
      gives you some of his to use instead. One of my favourite nuggets of
      information is in the appendix - *How to validate an idea with $10 and a
      Facebook account*.

      You've built a product or service but you're not sure how to market it
      effectively. This book can offer you years of experience on how to tap
      into triggers that motivate buyers. 


      One of my favourite examples in this book is how Kit Kat paired their
      product with coffee in advertising during 2007 to revive sales. The
      pairing created a subliminal thought in people so that whenever they were
      around coffee, they were thinking of Kit Kat. 


      There's plenty of similar examples so it's easy to apply to your own
      offering.
  - title: 'Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time'
    url: 'https://amzn.to/34B33Wv'
    body: >-
      Written by a co-creator of Scrum, this book is about project management
      and team building.


      I especially like Jeff's ideas around removing titles from people,
      practicing working hour limits and how to play planning poker
      effectively. 


      There's so much useful information in this book and largely written
      anecdotally, which makes it more relatable than other books on this
      subject.

      Entrepreneur Revolution: How to Develop your Entrepreneurial Mindset and
      Start a Business that Works

      A sentence very early in Dan's powerful, inspirational and motivational
      book book got me hooked:


      > If you went back to the late 1900s you would find people working on the
      new machines - computers - making data. These are 'white-collar' factory
      workers.

      >

      > ...They sit at their work station and repeat their tasks for hours on
      end until the day is over. That is just how it is for most people who live
      in the industrial age.


      Have you ever had that questioning inside that asks why you're not using
      your own skills for your own passions? If so, this book is a must read.
