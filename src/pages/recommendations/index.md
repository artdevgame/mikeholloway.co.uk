      Understand how to form ideas and how to develop them into reality. I
      really like the language used in this book, it's very simple to follow and
      really inspirational. Good examples of ideas to monetize.

      I'm really inspired by others that have managed to break free of the 9-5
      and chart their own course in life by following their passion but it can
      seem so daunting if you have bills to pay and other responsibilities that
      prevent you going all in. This book is great for giving you ideas on how
      to build side projects when you have a little downtime and how to monetize
      your ideas.


      If you don't have ideas of your own, still read this book as the author
      gives you some of his to use instead. One of my favourite nuggets of
      information is in the appendix - *How to validate an idea with $10 and a
      Facebook account*.
